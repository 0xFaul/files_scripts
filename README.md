## Contributing

Contributions to the app are most welcome, the main areas where help is needed are:
  * üåç **Translations**  
The app can be translated through the [Nextcloud community](https://www.transifex.com/nextcloud/nextcloud/content/) in Transifex

If there is something you need that is currently not possible (or complex) to do with scripting API, please open a GitHub ticket, or even better, a pull request! 
  * üìÉ **Documentation**  
The documentation of this project is still quite lacking. If you have any suggestions or improvements please do help out!
